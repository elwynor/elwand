 This parameter controls the number of points transferred
 from the "rammee" to the "rammer" whenever one Android
 rams another (if the rammee has any points).

 A value of 1000 here would mean that ramming your
 opponents is the whole point of the game; players would
 only pick up prizes as an afterthought.  A value of 10
 gives ramming another player a higher value than any
 normal prize, but not so high a value that the prizes
 are ignored.

RAMPTS {Number of points transferred upon ramming 10} N 0 1000

 The number of points per ordinary prize is fixed.  You
 can change the number of bonus points given to a player
 for picking up a flashing diamond that appears from time
 to time on the play field.

BONPTS {Number of points for the diamond bonus 100} N 0 1000

 You can change the penalty for hitting a wall or obstacle
 to give the game a subtly different "feel."

 A high value puts a premium on exactness and accuracy in
 moving one's Android and discourages the use of keyboard
 macros.  A low value permits more sloppiness on the part
 of the players and tends to increase the average score.

PTSDED {Number of points deducted for hitting obstacles 5} N 0 1000

 Users calling in at lower baud rates may experience buffer
 overflow due to lengthy ANSI sequences and the number of
 players in the game.  To reduce the chance of buffer
 overflow, you can control the maximum number of 300-baud
 players admitted to the game.

BDRTB1 {Maximum number of players, if any, at 300 baud 0} N 0 6

 Users calling in at lower baud rates may experience buffer
 overflow due to lengthy ANSI sequences and the number of
 players in the game.  To reduce the chance of buffer
 overflow, you can control the maximum number of 1200-baud
 players admitted to the game.

BDRTB2 {Maximum number of players, if any, at 1200 baud 2} N 0 6

 Users calling in at lower baud rates may experience buffer
 overflow due to lengthy ANSI sequences and the number of
 players in the game.  To reduce the chance of buffer
 overflow, you can control the maximum number of 2400-baud
 players admitted to the game.

BDRTB3 {Maximum number of players, if any, at 2400 baud 4} N 0 6

 Users calling in at lower baud rates may experience buffer
 overflow due to lengthy ANSI sequences and the number of
 players in the game.  To reduce the chance of buffer
 overflow, you can control the maximum number of 4800-baud
 players admitted to the game.

BDRTB4 {Maximum number of players, if any, at 4800 baud 6} N 0 6

 Users calling in at lower baud rates may experience buffer
 overflow due to lengthy ANSI sequences and the number of
 players in the game.  To reduce the chance of buffer
 overflow, you can control the maximum number of 9600-baud
 players admitted to the game.

BDRTB5 {Maximum number of players, if any, at 9600 baud 6} N 0 6

 Users calling in at lower baud rates may experience buffer
 overflow due to lengthy ANSI sequences and the number of
 players in the game.  To reduce the chance of buffer
 overflow, you can control the maximum number of 19200-baud
 players admitted to the game.

BDRTB6 {Maximum number of players, if any, at 19200 baud 6} N 0 6

 Users calling in at lower baud rates may experience buffer
 overflow due to lengthy ANSI sequences and the number of
 players in the game.  To reduce the chance of buffer
 overflow, you can control the maximum number of 38400-baud
 players admitted to the game.

BDRTB7 {Maximum number of players, if any, at 38400 baud 6} N 0 6

 Androids game.

LEVEL6 {Elwynor Technologies: Androids}

 You can modify the playfield to include: different sizes
 and shapes of obstacles; different initial distribution
 of prizes; or the width of the playfield.  Make sure that
 any blank cell can actually be reached from any other blank
 cell, or the prizes will accumulate in areas that cannot
 be reached (except by being rammed).

INTRO3 {[2J[0;1;33m[2;%dH** ANDROIDS! **[32m

The year is 2089.  Humans have merged with machines to become the ultimate
power of the known universe: Androids!  The Androids stay in fighting trim
by playing a game in which "prizes" of different values appear at random at
various locations within an enclosed playing area.  The object of the game
is to accumulate as many points as possible, both by beating your opponents
to the prizes, and by "ramming" your opponents to take their points away.
You may become invisible at any time, to avoid pursuit or to ambush your
opponents.  Special high-voltage obstacles litter the playfield, and the
border is made of duodenum alloy... points are deducted for colliding with
any of these.  Top-three listings include total points and points per hour.
} T Introductory description of Androids!


INSTRS {
If your cursor-movement keys generate ANSI output, you can use them to move
around.  This works under standard PC comm programs such as ProComm and
Telix.  Otherwise, you can use the following keys:  "I" to move up, "J" to
move left, "K" to move right, and "M" to move down.  Press <Spacebar> to become
invisible.  Press <Return> at any time to interrupt play.

DETAILS3 {
Androids! is the first real-time, multi-player, ANSI-graphics game developed
for The Major BBS. Each player is represented by a letter that moves around
with the cursor keys, picking up "prizes" and trying to "ram" the letters
representing the other players.

Running over a prize adds that prize's digit value to your score, and makes
the prize re-materialize somewhere else at random on the playfield.
When you ram into another player, %d points are subtracted from that player's
score and added to yours (if the other player has any points).  Each time you
collide into a wall or any of the obstacles in the playfield, you lose %d
points.

From time to time blinking diamond bonus prizes will appear, each worth %d
bonus points.  (The bell sound is used both for this bonus and for lost
points, so don't get them confused!)  A variety of special effects, such as
mystery or invisible prizes and players or varying bonus distributions, change
the underlying game parameters at one-minute intervals.

This game creates huge amounts of interrupt overhead on the system, so avoid
using keystroke "macros."  File uploads may also be affected during play.

NOANSI {
Unfortunately, you do not have ANSI-display capability enabled, so it is not
possible for you to play this game.  To enable ANSI, check your
communications program terminal emulation settings for one labeled "ANSI-BBS"
or "VT-100."  If your terminal program does not automatically sense ANSI, you
may have to change your Account Display/Edit setting to ANSI ON.

Unfortunately, your screen is too narrow to display the playfield for this
game.  You must be able to display at least %d characters per line.  If your
terminal can display this many characters, you may have to change your Account
Display/Edit setting to reflect this number.
} T Androids! rebuff if screen too narrow


S2SHRT {
Unfortunately, your screen is too short for the playfield and other game
information.  You must be able to display at least 24 lines.  If your terminal
can display 24 lines, you may have to change your Account Display/Edit setting
to reflect this number.

NOGOOD {
Unfortunately, %ld baud is not fast enough to play this game.  The ANSI
sequences can be quite lengthy and you may experience buffer overflow.
Try calling back at a higher baud rate, if possible.
